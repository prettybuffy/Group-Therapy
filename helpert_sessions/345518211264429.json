I feel very low in myself... very low self esteem... I couldn't concentrate on anything. I cannot think properly... I cannot even respond to other people in a proper way. sometimes used to zone out trom realitv...ldon't know what to do.. and I have no friends And when I wasn't knowing about all of this.. he even told me that he wanted to marry me and I should talk to my parents about our marriage ... I did that too.. but when I told him that l've talked to my parents about our marriage.. he started ghosting me.. he stopped responding and replying... I don't know what to do.. I'm emotionally drained and feeling lost.. I don't know where my life would take me.. he had promised a future with me.. and now he's with someone else.. he had lied about his family and background to that girl.. she doesn't even know the real him... but l've been with him for 6 years.. he shared all good and bad things to me.. but he's distant now... and I realised that I don't have many memories of him.. I was always giving to this relationship... he had used me mentally, physically and financially.. he made me an empty vessel... I feel so lost that I cannot even tell..",

It sounds like you've been treated very poorly by your ex-partner and it's left you feeling incredibly hurt, both emotionally and mentally. Not only did he betray your trust by cheating, but he also verbally and emotionally abused you, saying cruel, unwarranted things to you. To make matters worse, he gave you no closure, leaving you to grapple with this pain alone, which I imagine has been extremely confusing and upsetting for you. \n",

You're struggling to concentrate or interact with others properly, and his actions have you questioning your place in the world. It seems that you are feeling lost, not knowing where your life is headed, or how to process your emotions amid this disheartening turmoil. \n",
