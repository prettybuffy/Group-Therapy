While you're generally content in life, a significant worry has cropped up. You're beginning to question whether these goals that you've dedicated so much time and effort to are really what you want. This came to the forefront recently when you had a spontaneous and joy-filled day during a break from your work towards your goals. The pure happiness you felt that day caused you to wonder if your goals were truly satisfying or if they might even be misguided. The thought \"My goals are wrong\" has been nagging you, creating feelings of doubt and worry.\n\nAs a result, your behavior has changed. You find yourself taking more breaks that move you towards your goals. It's as if subconsciously, you're hesitating, afraid to move further down a path that might not lead to the happiness that you desire. This fear is incredibly paralyzing because it presents a lose-lose situation: either you keep going and potentially end up not happy, or you give up everything you've worked for on the chance that it might be the wrong path.\n\nDoes this narrative feel true to you?",
