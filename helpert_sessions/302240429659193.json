I had to call an ambulance but thankfully calmed down when they arrived and told me I was fine according to the instruments. I didn\u2019t think much of it until it happened again one week after I saw my wife\u2019s grand father at his funeral (April 2021). I was at the barber shop and had another episode this time it manifested as light headedness and low blood sugar. We have a history of diabetes and blood pressure so I thought it would be wise to go to a doctor and perform routine checkups (though I am 26 years old). The blood and other tests came back extremely normal. I also went to a cardiologist, he said I was \u201cunremarkable\u201d lol, which still makes me smile and also feel good a little. At this time I booked an appointment with a therapist and thought to speak about how I was feeling to navigate the anxiety I have and why I\u2019m having panic attacks. (I should mention that between my first and second attack my performance at work plummeted even though I\u2019m normally much more productive and responsible).",

It's like you're walking a tight line in these aspects of life, where there's not much room for middle grounds or mistakes. It must feel exhausting to constantly feel like things are so black or white, either perfectly right or dangerously wrong.\n",
